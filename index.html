	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I was born in Florida and moved to Michigan when I was 5. From there I moved to 
		Mississippi when I was 10, then back to Florida when I was 14. I went to highschool in the Jacksonville
		area then went to college at the University of Florida in Gainesville.

		After receiving my Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology at UF, I decided to come back to Jacksonville 
		for another Bachelor's degree at the University of North Florida. I wanted to pursue a Computer Science degree 
		so I began my <a href="computerskills.html">computer education</a> in the fall of 2018 with an anticipated 
		graduation date of May 2020.
